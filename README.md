# ML-Models-Comparison-Analysis
This project provides API functions for comparing ML models. To demonstrate their usages, demonstration program creates ML models and import functions from API program. Demonstration program therefoer gives statistical analyses of models and summaries of differences.

## Prerequisites
### Language and Platforms
- Python 3.8.5
- Jupyter notebook
### Tools
- Pandas 1.3.4
- Numpy 1.20.3
- Pickle 0.7.5
- sklearn 0.24.2
- Matplotlib 3.4.3
- Plotly 5.5.0
- LIME 0.2.0.1
- SHAP 0.40.0

## Set up
1. Install pip3 and Anaconda
2. With the installed tools, install Jupyter notebook and the mentioned tools above in Technologies such as:
```
Pip3 install pandas
```
3. Once all libraries are installed, open Jupyter notebook. Though this may vary depending on the OS and the version, opening the notebook in terminal is:
```
python3 -m notebook
```
4. With the provided API program, open a new document in Jupyter notebook and import functions in API program such as by:
```
import ipynb
from ipynb.fs.defs.ML_Comparison_API import *
```
5. Using the provided functions in API program, load own's ML models and enjoy!
